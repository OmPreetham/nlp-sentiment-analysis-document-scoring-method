pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk

```

No additional setup required beyond the installation of the dependencies listed above.

## Running the Script

To run the script, follow these steps:

```

if python is not working try python3 project.py

See the output and accuracy in Terminal

## Review

Describe any inputs that the user needs to provide or files that need to be in place:
